                The many waves of invaders who plundered and settled in Sardinia during the thousands of years of Sardinian history, came from the sea.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">For this reason the Sardinians, until recently, have never loved the sea and they built very few villages along the coast. The most important villages were built during the period of the Roman domination and before that under the Phoenician-Punic domination. Some examples are: Karalis (Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia), Nora, Tharros, Olbia and Turris Libissonis (Porto Torres) on the Northern coast of Sardinia.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character ny">A</span>rchaeological evidence of prehistoric human settlement on the island of Sardinia is present in the form of nuraghes and others prehistoric monuments, which dot the land. The recorded history of Sardinia begins with its contacts with the various people who sought to dominate western Mediterranean trade in Classical Antiquity: Phoenicians, Punics and Romans. Initially under the political and economic alliance with the Phoenician cities, it was partly conquered by Carthage in the late 6th century BC and then entirely by Rome after the First Punic War (238 BC). The island was included for centuries in the Roman province of Corsica et Sardinia, included in 3rd and 4th centuries in the Italia suburbicaria diocese.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">In the Early Middle Ages, through barbarian movements, the waning of the Byzantine Empire influence in the western Mediterranean and the Saracen raids, the island fell out of the sphere of influence of any higher government. This led to the birth of four kingdoms called Giudicati (Latin: Judicati; Sardinian: Judicados) in the 8th through 10th centuries. Falling under papal influence, Sardinia became the focus of the rivalry of Genoa and Pisa, the Giudicati and the Crown of Aragon, which eventually subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324. The Kingdom was to last until 1718, when it was ceded to the Piedmontese House of Savoy; later, in 1861, it would thus become the Kingdom of Italy and finally in 1946 the Italian Republic.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">A</span>ccording to Sardinian legend, after God created all the dry land and seas, he finally got around to creating boulders, which he then flung into the sea and trod upon. From this “ichnusa” (footprint, like the shape of Sardinia) an island was created which is a little continent unto itself containing every conceivable type of landscape. And to make Sardinia absolutely perfect, God took the creme de la creme of what he had already created elsewhere and spread it across the surface of this rocky island whose majestic mountain ranges stretch into the distance as far as the eye can see. </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">The granite of the Supramonte mountains rising in the distance almost looks like snow. Sardinia’s mountainous landscape has acted as a natural shield against outside control by conquerors and carabinieri, allowing shepherds to roam free and notorious bandits to hide in the rocky labyrinth formed by deep ravines and hidden caves.
